AccelerometerTest

=====

AccelerometerTest verifies that a mobile application written in
Appcelerator Titanium can successfully detect small vibrations such as
what may be produced by setting a mobile on a running dryer or washing
machine.

The vibration detection is the variance of the x, y, and z
accelerometer axes over a limited sample in time. The threshold for
positive vibration must be set manually after calibration.
